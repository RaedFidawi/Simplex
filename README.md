# Simplex solver for linear programs
Function is initially a minimization problem but it can change to max with the mode parameter. 
## How to run

- change mode to min or max depending on your use case

- Add your constraints, which are of the form (expression <= value), RHS, and  objective function

- run the main.py using

`python main.py`
